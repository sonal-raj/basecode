Little Deepu recently got a new job, so to celebrate, he decided to take his girfriend, Kate, out on a fancy candle light dinner.
To make things perfect for Kate, Deepu planned the night to the last detail. The food, the music, the ambience, everything was perfect, but stupidly enough Deepu forgot to get her a present.
After dinner, Kate asks our Deepu for her gift, when she finds out that he hasn't got her any she gets upset, to try smooth things with her, he proposes a game, this makes Kate so angry that she dumps him right there(bad move Deepu).
